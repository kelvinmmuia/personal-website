Update the projects page to remove the broken links to images using the images stored in the "public" folder, or as described below (some projects are hosted online already). Make the projects page more modern, interactive and more appealing.

Use the following as my avatar for the profile image for me. "C:\Users\USER\CascadeProjects\personal-website\public\CLS_9492_copy.jpg". Use the best practices around handling static images as you will use this below.

1. remove the following from the list of projects on project page; "EmpiricalFinance"; "M-Pesa API Integration", "Kenya Economic Survey Report 2023" from projects, it has nothing currently.
2. The project "Gapminder Data Visualization" is hosted and is displayed on the link "https://kelvinmwakamuia.shinyapps.io/GapminderDataVisualization/" A snapshot of the website or a preview of the same on my project page would do justice.
